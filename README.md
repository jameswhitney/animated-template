# animated-template
This project uses the [creative-tim tailwind css extenstion](https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/presentation) for styling
and the Animate on scroll library aka [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/).

It is currently a template for adding animations to pre-existing landing page examples.
